# baymax

(First years project #2)
Our group, The Maze Runners (movie reference #1), got the task to create an autonomous robot that needed to be able to get through a maze set up by the professors. Our amazing robot was baptized Baymax (movie reference #2)

For this we: 
- did some research on what sensors and other components would be suitable
- designed a frame in AutoFusion
- created said frame with a laser cutter, a lot of hot glue and even more ducttape
- struggled with stepper motors and their power supply
- after most of that struggle, switch to the Parallax system which uses servo motors
- learned that the bottom of an Arduino can create short-circuit and screw with your ultrasonic sensor data, should you put the Arduino directly on an aluminum frame (yes I know, I know)
- used the waterfall management method
- found the true importance of version control and using something like git (when your current code performs worse than the previous version and you have no idea what you wrote in said previous version)
- got very corny and geeky with names (see above)
